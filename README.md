## About CDC
Covenant University Developers Community (CDC) is a community exclusive to Covenant University students with interest in Software Development. It's open to all students regardless of skill, course of study or level.

### Purpose
The purpose of CDC is to:
- Help students learn and improve their software development skills, and
- Connect them with opportunities in the technology industry

One of our goals at CDC is to help newbies learn to code. Some of us have gone through the learning process. It's not easy. But it's possible. With proper guidance and mentorship, more students can learn code and become great Software Developers. We aim to create an inclusive environment where beginners are welcome and can learn from others with more knowledge and experience. We also desire to help people already on their journey into Software Development keep up until they achieve their goals.

In addition to providing a conducive environment for growth, we aim to provide opportunities for our members to kick-start or boost their careers in Software Development. We have several programs to help members prepare for and land tech scholarships, jobs, internships, participate in competitions, complete online courses and more. We actively search for and partner with other organizations to provide new opportunities for members of the community. We also organize events like workshops and hackathons where our members can learn, socialize and have fun.

### Values
- Openness
- Collaboration
- Curiosity
- Consistency


## How to Join CDC
There are 2 steps in joining CDC:
- Read the [CDC Manual][cmn].
- Attend your first General meeting for an induction.

Reading this manual is the first step in joining our community. Much as we'd like as many people as possible to join CDC, we want to make sure that our members imbibe our values and help us achieve our goals. This is your opportunity to evaluate us and decide if you want to be part of what we're building. If you are, we are happy to have you join us!

We have General meetings once every week when we all meet to discuss what we've been up to the past week. We use this avenue to induct new members into CDC. We'd get to know more about and you'd be able to ask us any questions you might have. We'd also add you to our online chat group ([Slack][slk]), our collaboration environment ([GitHub][ghb]) and issue you a tag with which you can gain access to the Hebron Startup Labs space. We can't wait to meet you!!!

## Activities
### Weekly Discussions
CDC is divided into [clusters][clu]. Every week, each cluster decides on a topic to discuss. During General meetings, they share with the rest of the community what they've learned and/or developed. The discussions are moderated by the leaders of the clusters (Cluster Managers).

### General Meetings
We have General meetings on Fridays from 4:00pm to 5:30pm at Hebron Startup Labs (HSL), CUCRID (3rd floor). General meetings provide an avenue for us to share our learnings and socialize with other members of the community, as well as induct new members and make important announcements.

### Management Meetings
Management meetings start immediately after the General meeting (5:30pm to 6:00pm). They are meant for Community Managers to discuss issues relating to CDC and make plans to move the community forward. If you're interested in assuming any leadership role, you can stay back for the meeting.

### Projects
At any given point in time, there are one or more projects going on at CDC, both cluster-specific and community-wide. Anyone is free to join in and contribute to any project they like, provided there are tasks available to be done. If you have an idea for a new project, please do share with us.

### Events
From time to time, we participate in and/or organize events like hackathons, workshops, competitions, meetups, conferences etc. We'll keep you posted via our Slack group of any upcoming events happening in or out of Covenant University and provide assistance where possible to help you attend.
